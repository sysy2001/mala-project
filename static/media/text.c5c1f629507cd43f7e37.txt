“Many people dream of operating a restaurant, but the reality isn't as glamorous as they imagine. We've had to get our hands dirty - from unclogging drains and cleaning toilets to even dragging drunk customers out of bathrooms and calling ambulances for them. We've been through it all.”

Amelie believes the societal perception that "it's unusual for immigrant women to run restaurants" has little impact on actual business operations. If you approach situations with a minority mindset, it affects your demeanor and ambitions, which in turn influences how others treat you. Mindset is crucial. One advantage of doing business in New York, or America in general, is that someone’s identity as an immigrant woman matters less than their capabilities. Business is business - landlords and investors only care about your competence and ability to generate profit. If you can demonstrate that, they'll make deals with you.

"I'm the first in my family to enter the restaurant business. During my junior year of high school, my parents initially suggested I apply to NYU's communications program. However, after research, I realized I didn't want a job sitting in front of the desk all day. At that time, I spent my weekends learning pastry-making from a New Zealand chef. His creations were very different from Chinese bakeries, and this experience sparked my passion in the culinary arts. Upon discovering that America had culinary schools offering degrees, I decided to apply to the Culinary Institute of America (CIA).

My father, who runs a wedding photography business, was surprisingly supportive when I expressed my interest in CIA during college application season. He believed I should pursue what I'm passionate about. My mother, however, strongly opposed the idea. I spent 1-2 months preparing a presentation deck to convince her."

"Bèn Bèn," which frequently appears on our menu, was my childhood nickname given by my mom, and the lion in our brand illustrations is also named Bèn Bèn.

"My goal evolved over time. When I first started school, I dreamed of becoming a celebrity chef. However, through my restaurant work experience and studies at CIA, I realized that chefs have limited influence and control over a restaurant's operations. There's so much happening in the dining area that you can't see from the kitchen. This led me to shift my post-graduation goal towards owning and operating my own restaurant. Looking back now, my actual expectations then might be different from how I remember them, as I've probably selectively held onto visions that motivated me to keep going."

"At the time, I didn't want to open just another typical Chinese restaurant in New York with poor working conditions. 

My vision was to build a platform where employees could grow alongside the company. I wanted “Málà Project” to be more like a collaborative project, similar to working on group assignments, rather than a traditional restaurant. Here, I'm not the only decision-maker—many decisions are made collectively or independently by team members. For instance, our director designs the wine list independently, our graphic designer Jingqi handles brand design, and even our dishware selection was a team decision. What matters most is the collaborative process where everyone participates and learns, rather than everything being done "my way.""

"Málà Project" has around 20 employees per location, and they have remarkable staff stability with minimal turnover. While all their chefs are from China, they don't emphasize work experience, instead, they focus on work ethic, personality, team chemistry, and cultural fit. They will provide consistent training. This approach has actually made recruitment easier for them, even though hiring for Chinese restaurants in New York is challenging for all owners. 

Their first East Village location took a year of preparation. The previous tenant, a pizza shop, had only a small, illegally constructed chimney. Chinese cooking requires a much larger ventilation system, but the government wouldn't approve their new chimney application for six months. They faced numerous other challenges in communicating with the government about renovations. For example, they weren't even allowed to install a storefront sign since no modifications to the exterior surface were permitted. Their solution was to place a neon sign with Chinese characters for "Málà Project" inside the window. Initially, many customers had trouble finding them with only the Chinese sign in the window, but over time, people got used to it.

"I chose to open Málà Project in New York partly because I was familiar with the city, and partly because I believed in the saying "if you can make it here in New York, you can make it anywhere." So I decided to take the leap. 
Interestingly, while we initially targeted international students and deliberately chose a location in the East Village near NYU's Washington Square Park campus, we were surprised by who actually came after opening. Our main customers turned out to be locals, and their acceptance of Chinese cuisine far exceeded our expectations. It was particularly touching to see Americans who were familiar with Chinese culture introducing our restaurant to friends who had never been to China, teaching them how to order dry pot, and even encouraging them to try specialties like chicken hearts and frog legs. They became unexpected cultural ambassadors. 
Since we didn't promote our restaurant on Chinese social media like WeChat or RED, it took about six months before we started seeing more of our intended target audience - international students."

"Although many Chinese restaurants now modify their dishes to cater to foreign tastes, we've stayed true to authentic Chinese flavors - which was my original vision. I believe that good food transcends cultural boundaries. Taste is an international language, so we only need to attract those who appreciate these flavors - which is already a substantial market. When we opened, we were pleasantly surprised to find that our main customers were Americans, and they could both appreciate and understand authentic Chinese flavors. 
Of course, it takes time to cultivate the market. For instance, no one ordered pig ears at first, but now both pig ears and Husband & Wife Lung Slices (beef and offal in chili sauce) are among our top sellers."

"Regardless of industry or age, we all face similar challenges in life.
This summer, I'm going through an extremely tough time, perhaps the most challenging period in my personal growth. I contemplated switching to restaurant tech. I've noticed that our employees excel at interaction, emotional intelligence, and leadership, yet their compensation is far below what they could earn in tech, which feels unfair to me. However, after this summer, I realized that I still belong in the culinary business - I was born for it. 
When faced with choices, I started observing myself like a lab mouse. I noticed that my actions and time consistently gravitated toward the restaurant business. Meanwhile, those career alternatives I'd been talking about for months never materialized into action - I kept focusing on my current work instead. This revealed that both my subconscious and reality were pointing me toward the path where I was already investing most of my time and energy."

"East Village doesn't have that typical New York metropolitan feel. Instead, it's home to many small businesses and immigrants from places like Japan and China, and everyone helps each other out. However, my circle in the restaurant industry remained relatively small for a couple of reasons: first, I was very young when I started and was an international student; second, I'm not particularly outgoing; third, people only reached out to others when they needed specific help, like advice about landlords or leads on affordable locations. 
My most important mentor was the owner of "Café China." I had established a good relationship while working there as a manager, and what I learned there has been the most valuable experience in my restaurant career. I'm also close with the owner of Fish Cheeks."

"I actually don't know how to cook Chinese food at all and never cook at home. In my family, my grandmother does all the cooking - even my mother doesn't cook. I studied Western cuisine at CIA and worked as a manager at Café China after graduation. I've always been hesitant about Chinese cooking because becoming a proper Chinese chef requires years of training and experience to be considered professionally qualified. 
However, studying Western cuisine at CIA gave me two fresh perspectives on Chinese food and restaurant management: I learned to appreciate Chinese cuisine as it is and respect the uniqueness of each regional style. I believe we shouldn't force fusion - for instance, prioritizing elaborate plating can make dishes cool down and lose their "wok hei" (breath of the wok), sacrificing flavor for aesthetics.
At the same time, I identified elements from Western dining that Chinese restaurants could benefit from: their approach to wine service, attention to ambiance, professional server attitude, and the unique dynamic between servers and guests. These aspects are typically overlooked in American Chinese restaurants."

"I chose Sichuan-style spicy dry pot as our signature dish simply because I love eating it myself. Among all Chinese cuisines, I miss Sichuan, Xi'an, and Northeastern dishes the most. Beijing cuisine doesn't excite me as much, probably because it's already a fusion of different regional styles.

My hometown is Tangshan in Hebei province, known for specialties like Matang, deep-fried dough sheets glazed with sugar syrup and Xianshi - a type of thin egg pancake."

"The pandemic's quiet period gave me time to rethink our brand identity. Over three versions - starting with a friend's design, then a collaboration between her and her partner that we used for two years but felt too refined - we finally found what we wanted with our current designer Jingqi. I stepped back and let her bring back the joyful, fun elements we were missing."
%
"I've gone through a shift in perspective regarding dish consistency. Initially, I worried about variations in our dishes across different scenarios: between locations, different days at the same location, different chefs' techniques, or even how ingredients and spices interact differently in each pot. Consistency is typically crucial for chain restaurants.
But my thinking evolved: dry pot's uniqueness lies in its variability - spiciness changes with the amount of ingredients, and each chef brings their own touch. Rather than fighting these differences, we should highlight them as features, even if it means challenging customers' expectations of standardization. As long as every pot is delicious, that's what truly matters. 
My current challenge is figuring out how to communicate this philosophy to customers, help them understand and appreciate this natural variation, especially since most diners expect consistency in their meals."
